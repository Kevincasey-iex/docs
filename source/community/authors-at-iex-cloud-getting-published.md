### How many times can I contribute content to IEX Cloud?

We highly encourage repeat contributions! If you have more ideas for content, please share them with our team. We’re excited to build relationships with our contributors and help you build your online presence in the financial data community.

### What formats of content are accepted? Do you accept videos, code snippets, or formats other than written text?

While many submissions are written articles, we’re also open to publishing videos, code samples, and any other formats that can serve as a learning aid. Content is generally published on our blog, so there will need to be some sort of written content to accompany whatever else you would like to contribute.

### What kind of style and structure should I use?

Here are a handful of tips for making content that’s a great fit for IEX Cloud:

Structure:

- Content should contain an introduction, sections and section headers, and a conclusion. See below for more details on what should be included in introductions and conclusions.
- Make information more digestible by breaking up content into bullet-point lists or numerical lists.
- Feel free to cite other articles or videos to help explain new terms or concepts.
Visuals and images are welcome and encouraged.

Style:

- Content should be clear, to the point, and as easy to understand as possible.
- Aim to write your content in a positive, friendly voice that’s also polished and professional.
- Use examples where possible or applicable.
- IEX Cloud uses AP Style.

One good example is this freeCodeCamp article [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-updating-excel-python-aws/), which walks you through how to use IEX Cloud in Excel.

### What should I include in my introduction and conclusion?

What exactly goes into your introduction depends on the topic, but most content will ideally include the following:

- The topic, including any tools or programming languages that will be used.
- For tutorials, an overview of key takeaways and what the audience can expect to learn.
- For more advanced topics, any prerequisites or background information the audience should already have on the topic in order to follow along (ideally including links to places where they can acquire that knowledge).

Please make sure to include a conclusion:

- For tutorials, summarize what was learned and any other next steps that can be taken after completing the tutorial steps.
- For non-tutorials, this can be simply providing closing thoughts or summarizing any key takeaways.
- If you would like to include an author bio, you can add that to the end of the piece alongside any contact information, such as your website link or email address.
