# Production-Ready Core Data

IEX Cloud Apperate comes with built-in data to power fintech applications and more. Here are some of the data types:

- Stocks / Equities
- Forex / Currencies
- Options
- Futures
- Commodities
- Economic Data
- Rates
- News
- Symbols / Mappings

Let's explore the Core Data.

## Exploring Core Data

All the data is available at REST API endpoints, and much of the data is available as [datasets](../reference/glossary.md#dataset) (requires Apperate plan) that you can also use in [views](../managing-your-data/creating-and-managing-views.md). Apperate lists these datasets (Core Data) at [**Data > Datasets > Core**](https://iexcloud.io/console/datasets/core).

Like all Apperate datasets, you can access their records via REST endpoints and via the dataset SQL editor.

The [Apperate API Reference](https://iexcloud.io/docs/) describes all the Core Data REST endpoints.

Now you're familiar with Core Data.

## What's Next

If you have data that you'd like to use with your apps, pull it into Apperate as demonstrated in [Migrating and Importing Data](../migrating-and-importing-data.md).

If you want to use Core Data in your apps, please see [Using Core Data](../using-core-data.md).
