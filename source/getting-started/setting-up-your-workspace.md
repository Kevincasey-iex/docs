# Setting Up Your Workspace

```{admonition} Early Access
The new data infrastructure product is available exclusively to select Early Access program participants. If youâ€™d like to participate in an upcoming Early Access phase, please email product@iexcloud.io.
```

A *workspace* is your unique domain for writing data and querying it, and delivering data to your apps. Your workspace name appears in your API URLs.

Here is the URL format with respect to the workspace name and an example URL.

**Workspace URL format:**

```
https://WORKSPACE.iex.cloud/v1/query/WORKSPACE/
```

**Example Workspace URL:**

```
https://mycompany.iex.cloud/v1/query/MYCOMPANY/
```

It's time to create your workspace.

## Creating Your Workspace

Here's how to create your workspace:

1. Click on the link in your Early Access program invitation email. The welcome page appears and prompts you to create your workspace.

1. Name your workspace.

    ```{important}
    The workspace name is permanent, so make sure to name it exactly how you want it.
    ```

    Workspace names have the following requirements.

    **Name requirements:**

    - Starts with a letter
    - Ends with a letter or number
    - Uses only lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes
    - Is between 2-63 characters long
    - DOES NOT consist of ALL numeric values

1. Agree to the terms and then click **Submit**. The **Create a dataset** page appears.

Your workspace is created and ready for delivering data to your apps!
