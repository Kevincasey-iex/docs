# What is IEX Cloud Apperate?

> **Note:** IEX Cloud Apperate is available exclusively to select Early Access Program participants If you would like to participate in the Early Access Program or Beta, please email us at `product@iexcloud.io`.

**We're developing a new product: an out-of-the-box data infrastructure that makes it quick and easy to ingest and deliver data into your application.** 

It combines the capabilities of ingestion, normalization, transformation, observability, and delivery, all in one end-to-end solution for application developers, growing businesses, and fintechs. 

If you're building a new app and need to set up its data infrastructure quickly, we help provide one out-of-the-box. If you already have an existing infrastructure, we integrate smoothly with what you have and can help you ingest from new data sources, normalize across financial identifiers, and scale as you grow.

This new functionality is now in alpha, with its first functionality ready for early use. **To read the full story on why we're building this and the problems it helps solve, check out our product manifesto.**

> **Note:** While this product is in alpha, certain functionality shown in the schematic above will be in active development.

## How does the Apperate functionality help me?

- **If you’re building an MVP – skip time-consuming backend work and get to market faster.** Connect your application to Apperate for a data infrastructure that works in minutes, rather than months. Hand us your data, and we‘ll create an auto-documented, ready-to-use, scalable API instantly to help you deliver  No code necessary. 

- **This is a system that already supports 1M operations per second, 2.5B API calls per day, and 150,000+ registered users.** If you’re spending significant time maintaining data infrastructure, we'll help support you. You’ll get to power your application with the same backend capabilities that power IEX Cloud today.  

- **Skip months of normalization work (and the effort to maintain that over time).** We’re building the capability to normalize across datasets, starting with financial data identifiers. When you hand us equities data, we’ll automatically detect which financial data identifiers it uses and make all your data speak the same language.   
 
## How does Apperate work?

This product is designed to reduce months of backend work into a handful of simple steps that take minutes. 

### Step one: Connect your data.  

- Drag-and-drop a file, schedule automated ingestion, or read, write and update data via API. Connect with common sources such as databases, data streams, AWS S3 buckets, data lakes and data warehouses. 
- Upon ingestion, we automatically detect and organize your data into a time series schema.
- If you provide equities data, we’ll take care of normalizing their identifiers with our fully-maintained financial data identification mapping.  

### Step two: Optionally, further customize and define your data.

- Create data views to perform quick data transforms on the fly. 
- We automatically generate documentation around your data – you just customize as needed. 

### Step three: Deliver your data. 

- Your data is now available via an instantly generated API endpoint private for your own use. No code required.  
- Control and monitor who accesses data (and how much) with built-in permissions and analytics.
